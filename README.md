# R-introduction

In this repository, I created tutorial documents on basic R usage and R Markdown for my fellow classmates in a university course. 
Inspiration for this small project came from receiving multiple requests for my assistance on these topics. 
I opted to tailor this tutorial toward the standard R skills that my classmates would need to better transition into the course and complete their first assignment.  
I also thought this would be a nice way to get myself reaquainted with R Markdown usage and showcasing some teaching abilities.
